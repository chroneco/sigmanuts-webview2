# Sigma's New User-friendly and Time-saving Solution to YouTube Chat Problem

**A *mostly* standalone app to serve widgets for your YouTube livestreams**

## Features

Sigmanuts offers a very flexible experience. The trade-off between having an extra app to run during live stream and having a positive chat experience is worth it!

- Works with any YouTube chat as long as you have access to it (public, private, unlisted, member-only, etc)
- No delay!
- Lightweight (to an extent)
- Supports in-app customization for chats
- Same widget structure as Streamelements - any custom Twitch chat can be adapted with a few tweaks
- Can run as many different widgets as you want
- Only update chat link once and have it refresh for every overlay in OBS
